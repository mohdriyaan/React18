When it comes to React it's all about components. Components are independent chunks of user interfaces. Components can as small as one HTML element such as button or it can be large as the whole application in one component.

<h3>Benefits Of Components:-<h3>
<ul>
<li>Independence:-Changing the logic or layout in one component will not break your whole app</li>
<li>Reusability:-You can reuse the components all throughout the application.</li>
<li>Speed:-Behind the Scenes The React is Using Virtual DOM whre only the components that needs to updated is affected.This is all done without any rendering which in turn increases the speed of the application.</li>
</ul>

These Components can be built together just like Lego Blocks to build super and complex apps without confusion.

The application can have as many as components but there will always be one root component.

Go to Create React App on Browser to install react package
